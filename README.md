## Page Load Time Optimization

Atlan SQL Editor is designed for a lightning-fast and responsive user experience. We have employed the following strategies to optimize page load time and overall performance:

- **WebP Images**: We use WebP image format with superior compression and quality to reduce image loading times without sacrificing visual appeal.

- **DOM Elements Reduction**: We optimized the DOM structure, minimizing unnecessary elements to speed up rendering and enhance user interactions.

- **Good Coding Practices**: Following industry standards, we ensure clean and efficient code for streamlined execution and improved responsiveness.

- **Lesser Dependencies**: We selectively use essential dependencies to maintain a lean codebase, leading to faster load times and enhanced maintainability.

- **Code Splitting**: By implementing code splitting, we load only essential parts for the initial view, reducing initial loading time and optimizing performance.

These strategies ensure that Atlan SQL Editor delivers a smooth and seamless experience to users, making SQL query composition and execution effortless and efficient.
